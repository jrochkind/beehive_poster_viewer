<h1>The Beehive Design Collective's Mesoamérica Resiste</h1>

<p>All art and narrative by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beehive_Design_Collective">Beehive Design Collective</a>.
</p>

<p>At the time of this writing (June 18 2017), the Beehive's web site is unavailable,
so I've put up just the Mesoamérica Resiste online poster at this temporary location.
</p>

<p>Please consider visiting the Beehive's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/beehivedesigncollective">facebook page</a> and <a href="https://weestore.myshopify.com/">web store</a>.  You can purchase
prints of the Mesoamérica Resiste poster at the web store!
