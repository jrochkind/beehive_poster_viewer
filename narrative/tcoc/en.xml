          <strong>To understand where we are,
          we must remember where
          we’ve been.</strong> In this nighttime
          scene, we find communities
          living as though their lives
          depend on the land around them.
          The night sky, undisturbed by

          The coal we use today
          in the US to supply
          over 50% of our
          electricity began its life
          over 300 million years
          ago, as giant plants decomposing
          and compressing in an ancient swamp. The
          decendents of these ancestors are still around todaywe
          know them as Ferns, Horsetails, and Club Mosses.
          The sunlight stored in those ancient fossils through
          photosynthesis is what we capture when we burn coalover
          10,000 years of compressed solar energy, consumed
          in a flash! And coal still does today what those
          plants did all those millenia
          ago- like a giant brita filter,
          it sucks heavy metals and
          toxins out of water and soil,
          sequestering them in the
          ground forever.

          <p>The Appalachian mountains
          are some of the oldest mountains
          on earth, and they are incredibly
          special. After massive
          glaciers buried northern habitats
          in a mile of ice, Appalchia
          served as the “seedbed” of
          North America, repopulating
          a desolate landscape with its
          abundant genetic stores. These
          “mixed mesophytic forests” are
          the most biodiverse temperate
          forests in the world!</p>
          <p>The mountains are also home
          to the headwaters of the major
          rivers of the eastern seaboard
          and the midwest. The water that
          flows from the taps of Atlanta
          and Washington originates here
          in the mountains, where it’s purified
          by underground coal seams.</p>

          The Appalachians are also amazingly special because of
          their unique, layered human history. And whether our
          ancestors were indigenous Cherokee or belonged to
          some very different place, somewhere in all our family
          histories are folks who knew how to live in a seasonal
          way in a cyclical world. Seen here planting seeds among
          the leaf litter of past seasons, these Grey Squirrels know
          that new life regenerates from death, and that all energy
          cycles.

          People have

          Seen here crash-landing in the

          oppression in Europe in small
          numbers to resettle as self-reliant
          homesteaders in the Appalachians.
          They carry the cultural and ideological
          baggage of all migrating peoples - religion

          Survival in the pre-industrial
          world meant resourcefulness,
          thrift, reusing old
          materials, and taking only
          what you could carry. Appalachian
          communities
          relied on their neighbors and
          on the food and fuel they
          could harvest themselves,
          much like the fishing Heron,
          the timbering &amp; building
          Beaver, and the gathering
          and gardening Snails (with
          their nutritous crop of corn,
          beans and squash). Folks
          used and changed the land
          to meet their needs, but they
          did so within the land’s
          ability to replenish itself.

          Cherokee was an oral

          nation’s first syllabary. Used to record Cherokee
          lifeways and letters and to defend rights to land and
          sovereignty in the face of genocide, The Phoenix bilingual
          newspaper reached Cherokee and white readers

          its survival.

          In 1838, the U.S.
          military forced
          the “removal” of over
          14,000 Cherokee men,
          women, and children from their desirable
          mountain real estate in the dead
          of winter. During the long, cold procession
          out of mineral-rich Appalachia
          into the “Indian Territory”
          of Oklahoma, over 4,000
          people died from starvation
          and deprivation. Although
          the majority of the Nation
          was lost or “relocated,”
          some Cherokee
          folks remained in the
          mountains, negotiating
          life in two worlds. Not disappeared though often invisibilized,
          indigenous folks persist in Appalachia, and
          are present in this poster for generations to come.

          sought not only to rid the U.S. of indigenous peoples
          seen as “in the way,” but to convert all available land,
          labor, and resources to profits for those in power.

          The arrival of the railroad brought an erosion

          The wealth, industry, and Empire of the US were built
          on the resources of rural and wild lands (at home and
          abroad), powered with the dust of dirty coal, and prospered
          by the sweat of miners and workers. As we see
          in the center of the graphic, where a massive mine site
          is tearing into the landscape, colonies like Appalachia
          were sacrified on the altar of “the greater good”- progress,
          power, and prosperity. And just as rural places gave
          birth to the modern industrial world, the rising powers
          of government, banks, and big business also shaped
          the profile of Appalachia, transforming a region rich
          in traditions of land-based self-reliance into a jobcentered
          mono-economy reliant almost
          entirely on a single, non-renewable

          For over a century, coalfield communities watched the
          wealth of Appalachia carted out of the mountains by
          the trainload, leaving behind little of the prosperity
          or profits the “black diamonds” earned for absentee
          land owners. Today, coal mining operations are highly
          mechanized, using massive machines -like the 22-story
          tall dragline below -to excavate the thin seams of coal
          that run flat through the mountains like icing between
          layers of a cake. Unlike underground mines, which were
          worked with the hand-held pick and shovel, MTR and
          other forms of strip mining use explosives to expose
          and access underground coal seams, utterly decimating
          the soil, habitat, and critters above. The fractured
          mountain chunks, called “overburden,” are dumped in
          nearby waterways, polluting them with “valley fills”-
          inside out, upside down mountains. Over 2,000 miles
          of rivers are already buried, while 450,000 acres -an
          area bigger than Manhattan, distributed over 450 distinct,
          named mountain tops -have been flattened into
          lifeless moonscape.

          In 1950 there were 150,000 coal miners in Appalachia.
          <b>Today, fewer than 15,000 remain.</b> And where an underground
          mine once employed 200 men, (and today
          employs only 30), an MTR site requires only 15 workers
          to extract vastly more coal. Through mechanization
          and union busting efforts by Massey Energy and
          other companies, the coal industry has eliminated so
          many jobs that many thousands of Appalachians have
          been forced to leave the mountains. Here, a continuous
          mining machine undercuts union power by chewing
          up UMWA helmets and lunchpails, while miners
          (the Rattler), farmers
          (the Skunk), and grannies
          (the Possum) use
          their unique and potent
          defense mechanisms
          to fight back!
          Such direct actions (and
          even industrial sabotage)
          have been key tools of
          coalfield resistance for
          decades.

          The ecological diversity in this graphic is a metaphor

          removal destroys renewable resources- a forest
          that could be replanted, a road that could be rebuilt.
          <strong>But other losses are permanent.</strong> Fertile top soil,
          made rich over millenia, takes more than 500 years to
          accumulate even half an inch. Once extinct, endemic
          species (native only to a particular mountaintop or
          stream) take with them unique evolutionary adaptations-
          whole genetic languages that fall silent in their
          absence. Like soil or species, the fabric of community
          life -languages and dialects, skills for sustenance and
          survival, stories and songs -once unraveled through
          depopulation and degradation, are gone forever.

          Coal provides us with elecricity, but is also central
          to the manufacture of concrete, steel, and consumer
          goods, the building blocks of our industrial world. As
          multinational corporations and monolithic financial institutions
          (like the World Trade Organization, The World
          Bank, and The International Monetary Fund) force local
          economies to play ball in a global marketplace rigged to
          favor rich countries, manufacturing is “outsourced” to
          poorer countries (who have even fewer environmental
          regulations and labor laws than the US). This means
          coal extracted in Appalachia is shipped all around the

          Latin America, where everything from essential goods to

          Thanks to the Clean Air Act, coal is washed before it’s
          burned (to get some -<i>never all</i>- of the toxins out). But
          the deadly rinse water has to go somewhere- usually,
          back up the mountain into unlined, open air pits held
          back by some of the largest earthen dams in the world
          (the most famous of these is directly above Marshfork
          Elementary School in the Coal River Valley of W. Virginia).
          This “sludge” is even injected into old underground
          mines, (where it leaches and leaks into aquifers
          and wells), or illegally dumped into waterways.

          <h4>Clean Coal is a Dirty Lie</h4>
          <p><strong>Coal can never be clean.</strong>
          A non-renewable fossil fuel
          containing almost every element in the periodic table,
          coal cannot be mined, burned, or stored without extensive
          damage and destruction. Yet the same corporatations
          and big government officials that are encouraging
          us to shop away our guilt about climate change
          are labeling coal “clean”- and hoping we won’t notice
          we’ve been greenwashed.

          <h4>The Gifts of Coal, The Threats of Coal</h4>
          <p>Across the MTR pit (and a world away) from the Big
            City, we see Appalachian communities struggling with
            the complicated legacy of coal mining and the repressive
            stranglehold of today’s coal mono-economy. The
            seeming gifts of coal, including jobs, pensions, and subsidies
            for basic community services, are trucked in with
            a sparkling Santa smile. On the other hand, the bared
            teeth of intimidation and the spotlight of surveillance
            show the sinister side of coal- one that uses violence
            and threats to silence dissent and coerce complicity.</p>

          <p>“Paperwrenching”

          defending their neighborhoods through direct action
          and advancing a revised definition of “power”- <b><i>community

          <p>
            After generations of outsiders
            telling tales of Appalachia
            far and wide, young
            folks like this Possum Mama
            are seizing the airwaves and
            telling their communities’ stories themselves. The future
            belongs to those who tell a better story, and documentary
            journalism not only outs coal industry corruption,
            it trains storytellers for the next generation.

            Social movements have
            always had music, art, and
            culture at the center of their
            organizing strategy. Whether
            at an old time revival or a
            mountain punk show, these
            critters are fueling the resistance
            with homegrown tunes

          What does a regional Appalachian economy look like
          without coal at the center? Here, folks each bring a
          different ingredient and skill to a Local Foods Cooperative
          (canning chow-chow and other preserves). Inspired
          by community commerical kitchens,
          where small producers can work together
          to scale-up production and
          contend with bigger markets, this
          scene reminds us that production
          and trade can be equitable,
          sustainable, and nourishing.

          If you’ve seen the Beehive’s
          <i>Plan Colombia</i> graphic, you
          might remember the Paper
          Wasps as North American
          colonizers and consumers-
          bad guys with bad habits.
          Here, the Wasps are getting their
          act together, building an affordable
          urban housing project that’s energy
          efficient, pooling their resources, reducing energy consumption,
          and retrofitting their nest with insulation and
          a couple of solar panels. No longer just consumers,
          they’ve started a print collective (get it? <i>Paper</i> Wasps?)
          and are teaching themselves forgotten skills for how
          to live and work cooperatively - and even taking turns
          doing the dishes!

          Communities are saying NO to extractive
          power from mega-utilities in
          favor of democratically distributed,
          locally-produced, renewable energy.
          Not only is this better for Appalachia,
          but it’s also far more efficient,
          as nearly two-thirds of all electricity “from the grid”
          is wasted, dissipating on the lines during transmission!
          What if we measured energy in
          terms of what we can generate with
          our bodies and communities, not what
          can be extracted from the earth?

          Our story’s end is also a beginning: a scene
          of reunion. Birds representing young
          folks returning home (after generations
          of migration and displacement)
          are welcomed into the
          waiting arms of their communities,
          where their energy is urgently needed
          to build the future of Appalachia.

          <h4>A living Ecology</h4>
          <p>These critters appear in this graphic
          because they are significant to the
          Appalachian Mountains, both ecologically
          and culturally. For folks who
          spend time in the woods, hunting
          and fishing and playing, gathering
          ginseng for cash or bloodroot for
          sickness, this is not a static natural
          history roster, but a familiar cast of characters in a
          beloved and threatened natural world.</p>
