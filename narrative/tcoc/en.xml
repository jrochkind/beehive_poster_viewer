          <strong>To understand where we are,
          we must remember where
          we’ve been.</strong> In this nighttime
          scene, we find communities
          living as though their lives
          depend on the land around them.
          The night sky, undisturbed by

          The coal we use today
          in the US to supply
          over 50% of our
          electricity began its life
          over 300 million years
          ago, as giant plants decomposing
          and compressing in an ancient swamp. The
          decendents of these ancestors are still around todaywe
          know them as Ferns, Horsetails, and Club Mosses.
          The sunlight stored in those ancient fossils through
          photosynthesis is what we capture when we burn coalover
          10,000 years of compressed solar energy, consumed
          in a flash! And coal still does today what those
          plants did all those millenia
          ago- like a giant brita filter,
          it sucks heavy metals and
          toxins out of water and soil,
          sequestering them in the
          ground forever.

          <p>The Appalachian mountains
          are some of the oldest mountains
          on earth, and they are incredibly
          special. After massive
          glaciers buried northern habitats
          in a mile of ice, Appalchia
          served as the “seedbed” of
          North America, repopulating
          a desolate landscape with its
          abundant genetic stores. These
          “mixed mesophytic forests” are
          the most biodiverse temperate
          forests in the world!</p>
          <p>The mountains are also home
          to the headwaters of the major
          rivers of the eastern seaboard
          and the midwest. The water that
          flows from the taps of Atlanta
          and Washington originates here
          in the mountains, where it’s purified
          by underground coal seams.</p>

          The Appalachians are also amazingly special because of
          their unique, layered human history. And whether our
          ancestors were indigenous Cherokee or belonged to
          some very different place, somewhere in all our family
          histories are folks who knew how to live in a seasonal
          way in a cyclical world. Seen here planting seeds among
          the leaf litter of past seasons, these Grey Squirrels know
          that new life regenerates from death, and that all energy
          cycles.

          People have

          Seen here crash-landing in the

          oppression in Europe in small
          numbers to resettle as self-reliant
          homesteaders in the Appalachians.
          They carry the cultural and ideological
          baggage of all migrating peoples - religion

          Survival in the pre-industrial
          world meant resourcefulness,
          thrift, reusing old
          materials, and taking only
          what you could carry. Appalachian
          communities
          relied on their neighbors and
          on the food and fuel they
          could harvest themselves,
          much like the fishing Heron,
          the timbering &amp; building
          Beaver, and the gathering
          and gardening Snails (with
          their nutritous crop of corn,
          beans and squash). Folks
          used and changed the land
          to meet their needs, but they
          did so within the land’s
          ability to replenish itself.

          Cherokee was an oral

          nation’s first syllabary. Used to record Cherokee
          lifeways and letters and to defend rights to land and
          sovereignty in the face of genocide, The Phoenix bilingual
          newspaper reached Cherokee and white readers
          alike with a strong, clear message: the

          its survival.

          In 1838, the U.S.
          military forced
          the “removal” of over
          14,000 Cherokee men,
          women, and children from their desirable
          mountain real estate in the dead
          of winter. During the long, cold procession
          out of mineral-rich Appalachia
          into the “Indian Territory”
          of Oklahoma, over 4,000
          people died from starvation
          and deprivation. Although
          the majority of the Nation
          was lost or “relocated,”
          some Cherokee
          folks remained in the
          mountains, negotiating
          life in two worlds. Not disappeared though often invisibilized,
          indigenous folks persist in Appalachia, and
          are present in this poster for generations to come.

          sought not only to rid the U.S. of indigenous peoples
          seen as “in the way,” but to convert all available land,
          labor, and resources to profits for those in power.

          The arrival of the railroad brought an erosion

          The wealth, industry, and Empire of the US were built
          on the resources of rural and wild lands (at home and
          abroad), powered with the dust of dirty coal, and prospered
          by the sweat of miners and workers. As we see
          in the center of the graphic, where a massive mine site
          is tearing into the landscape, colonies like Appalachia
          were sacrified on the altar of “the greater good”- progress,
          power, and prosperity. And just as rural places gave
          birth to the modern industrial world, the rising powers
          of government, banks, and big business also shaped
          the profile of Appalachia, transforming a region rich
          in traditions of land-based self-reliance into a jobcentered
          mono-economy reliant almost
          entirely on a single, non-renewable

          For over a century, coalfield communities watched the
          wealth of Appalachia carted out of the mountains by
          the trainload, leaving behind little of the prosperity
          or profits the “black diamonds” earned for absentee
          land owners. Today, coal mining operations are highly
          mechanized, using massive machines -like the 22-story
          tall dragline below -to excavate the thin seams of coal
          that run flat through the mountains like icing between
          layers of a cake. Unlike underground mines, which were
          worked with the hand-held pick and shovel, MTR and
          other forms of strip mining use explosives to expose
          and access underground coal seams, utterly decimating
          the soil, habitat, and critters above. The fractured
          mountain chunks, called “overburden,” are dumped in
          nearby waterways, polluting them with “valley fills”-
          inside out, upside down mountains. Over 2,000 miles
          of rivers are already buried, while 450,000 acres -an
          area bigger than Manhattan, distributed over 450 distinct,
          named mountain tops -have been flattened into
          lifeless moonscape.

          In 1950 there were 150,000 coal miners in Appalachia.
          <b>Today, fewer than 15,000 remain.</b> And where an underground
          mine once employed 200 men, (and today
          employs only 30), an MTR site requires only 15 workers
          to extract vastly more coal. Through mechanization
          and union busting efforts by Massey Energy and
          other companies, the coal industry has eliminated so
          many jobs that many thousands of Appalachians have
          been forced to leave the mountains. Here, a continuous
          mining machine undercuts union power by chewing
          up UMWA helmets and lunchpails, while miners
          (the Rattler), farmers
          (the Skunk), and grannies
          (the Possum) use
          their unique and potent
          defense mechanisms
          to fight back!
          Such direct actions (and
          even industrial sabotage)
          have been key tools of
          coalfield resistance for
          decades.

          The ecological diversity in this graphic is a metaphor
          for the cultural vitality of the region, both of which
          are threatened by destruction from MTR. Mountaintop
          removal destroys renewable resources- a forest
          that could be replanted, a road that could be rebuilt.
          <strong>But other losses are permanent.</strong> Fertile top soil,
          made rich over millenia, takes more than 500 years to
          accumulate even half an inch. Once extinct, endemic
          species (native only to a particular mountaintop or
          stream) take with them unique evolutionary adaptations-
          whole genetic languages that fall silent in their
          absence. Like soil or species, the fabric of community
          life -languages and dialects, skills for sustenance and
          survival, stories and songs -once unraveled through
          depopulation and degradation, are gone forever.

          Thanks to the Clean Air Act, coal is washed before it’s
          burned (to get some -<i>never all</i>- of the toxins out). But
          the deadly rinse water has to go somewhere- usually,
          back up the mountain into unlined, open air pits held
          back by some of the largest earthen dams in the world
          (the most famous of these is directly above Marshfork
          Elementary School in the Coal River Valley of W. Virginia).
          This “sludge” is even injected into old underground
          mines, (where it leaches and leaks into aquifers
          and wells), or illegally dumped into waterways.

            Floods and erosion from MTR are a constant reality in
            the coalfields, but residents live with an even deadlier
            threat- impoundment collapse. The 2008 TVA spill of
            toxic, radioactive fly ash (another type of coal waste)
            near Harriman, TN wasn’t the first time coal industry
            recklessness caused a life-threatening disaster in the
            coalfields. The Buffalo Creek dam break of 1972 killed
            118 in West Virginia; the 2000 spill in Inez, Kentucky
            buried 100 miles of waterways. Engineers say, it’s not a
            question of <i>if</i> the impoundments will break, but <i>when</i>.

          Hurriane Katrina, or the BP Oil Blowout- are carried
          by folks who didn’t create them or profit from them,
          while the responsible parties get tax breaks and bailouts
          and aren’t held accountable for cleaning up their
          messes. They even make money off reconstruction!</p>
          <h4>Clean Coal is a Dirty Lie</h4>
          <p><strong>Coal can never be clean.</strong>
          A non-renewable fossil fuel
          containing almost every element in the periodic table,
          coal cannot be mined, burned, or stored without extensive
          damage and destruction. Yet the same corporatations
          and big government officials that are encouraging
          us to shop away our guilt about climate change
          are labeling coal “clean”- and hoping we won’t notice
          we’ve been greenwashed.

            a sparkling Santa smile. On the other hand, the bared
            teeth of intimidation and the spotlight of surveillance
            show the sinister side of coal- one that uses violence

          Building upon an inheritance
          of cultural
          resilience and collective
          organizing passed
          down for generations,
          Appalachian community
          groups are speaking
          out and standing up for
          the mountains and the
          miners! Educating their folks about MTR’s health impacts,
          hosting vigils, and organizing rallies and marches,
          these activist “pollinators” are fighting for their homes,
          their mountains, their livelihoods, and their lives at great
          personal risk. Through documentation, petitions, lobbying,
          lawsuits, and non-violent civil disobedience, they
          are laboring to make their voices heard in Washington’s
          halls of power. Despite EPA lipservice, MTR continues,
          along with coal company threats and acts of violence.

          With the vicious backlash of the coal industry
          against such public organizing, most
          Appalachians resist through private
          acts of perseverance. For many, continuing
          to hunt and fish on “company
          property”- the mountains that
          are everyone’s backyard- is an act of
          courage and defiance.

          Parachuting in to lend a paw are
          activists from outside the coalfields,
          represented by the Tortoise
          and the Hare. They carry
          different tools and tactics for
          the struggle, including access to
          education, technology, and social
          movements. By respectfully taking
          direction from local leaders,
          these activists can be instrumental
          in supporting coalfield resistance;
          they’re less likely to be violently
          targeted for their efforts, so
          they can engage in direct actions,
          documentation, and organizing.

          <p>“Paperwrenching”
          means death to Big
          Coal by a thousand
          paper cuts! Here, a
          multitasking millipede
          turns the MTR permitting
          process, weak environmental
          legislation, and a mountain
          of other paperwork into
          potent ammunition against
          the construction of a new coal-fired power plant. Aiming
          to “exhaust the administrative capacity” of government
          regulators like the Office of Surface Mining, her
          paper airplanes are gumming up the gears of the coal
          industry machine, effectively buying time for community-based
          activists to halt it for good.</p>
          <p> Meanwhile, in the low-income barrios and neighborhoods
          of the city, resourceful urban critters like the
          Squirrel, Cockroach, Cat, and even the carefully coiffed
          Poodle aren’t standing for Big Coal’s ongoing assault of
          air pollutants or huge doses of toxins. Instead, they are
          defending their neighborhoods through direct action
          and advancing a revised definition of “power”- <b><i>community
          power</i></b>. With over 150 new coal-fired power
          plants slated for contruction in during the final years
          of the Bush administration, dozens have already been
          defeated through such grassroots resistance!</p>
