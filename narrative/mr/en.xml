        <p>With the shutters closed, the outside of the poster resembles an old Spanish conquistador&#x2019;s map
        of Mesoamerica. The map is a top-down look at the region and
        draws parallels between colonial history and modern-day capitalism. Outsiders who have no connection with the land have drawn this map, with motives of extraction and profit.</p>

        <p>Mesoamerica is a cultural and geographic region that forms a thin land bridge (or isthmus) between North and South America and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans&#x2014;making this region highly strategic for international trade. Due
        to its climate and geography, Mesoamerica is one of the most biodiverse
        areas on the planet.

        <p>Since the invasion of Hern&#xE1;n Cort&#xE9;s&#x2019; metal-clad armies in 1519, a long succession of foreign colonizers and transnational corporations have occupied and exploited Mesoamerica. Corporations and the U.S. State have referred to Mexico and Central America as their &#x201C;backyard&#x201D; since the early 1800s. Now with free trade agreements working to eliminate so many &#x201C;barriers&#x201D; to trade (like environmental and labor rights, industry is all the more eager to develop infrastructure in Mesoamerica to exploit the region</p>
        <p>In 2001 the president of Mexico and the Interamerican Development Bank introduced a plan to literally pave the way for implementing free trade policies. Named Plan Puebla Panama (PPP), the original plan included the southern states of Mexico (from Puebla) and the countries of Central America (to Panama). After fierce opposition throughout the region, the PPP underwent a public relations makeover and in 2008 was renamed the Mesoamerican Integration and Development Project, or Project Mesoamerica. The plan now includes Colombia and the Dominican Republic.</p>

        <p>Project Mesoamerica consists of 8 initiatives to &#x201C;strengthen regional integration and promote economic and social development,&#x201D; but the bulk of the funding is going towards large-scale infrastructure projects for transportation, to increase &#x201C;market competitiveness&#x201D; by moving high volumes of commerce through the region. These highways, ports, and canals connect with factory zones, mines and resource extraction sites, and large-scale energy projects that power it all.</p>
        <p>These plans are unfolding in the context of the expanding War on Drugs, which has led to dramatically increased violence and further militarization of the U.S./Mexico border.</p>

export. Railroads and tanks circle the game, reminding us
of the violent history of the United Fruit Company (now Chiquita) in Central America: controlling large tracts of land, repressing workers, and even supporting a coup that led to decades of dictatorship in Guatemala, overthrowing a democratically elected president who tried to redistribute land to the people.</p>

        <p>Modern industrial cargo boats morphed with ships from the &#x201C;Age of Expansion&#x201D; sail across the map, some hauling away cash crops and others bringing imports.</p>
        <p>Three of these ships tell the story of the Triangle Trade of the late 1500s to early 1800s, the Atlantic Slave Trade circuit that relied on trafficking gold, sugar, and humans. Rum, made from sugar, was moved across the ocean to Africa and used to corrupt local leaders into facilitating the slave hunt. European colonists then shipped enslaved peoples to the sugar plantations in the Caribbean, where sugar was picked up and sent to Europe (and New England) to
        turn into rum, completing the triangle.</p>

The IDB relies on its finger-puppet governments to shake down the public

This ground&#x2019;s eye view reflects the experiences of those who are rooted in a place and directly affected by the plans on the map. Between the roots of the ceiba, lively scenes illuminate stories of grassroots organizing and community resilience. This graphic documents many examples
      of alternatives to top-down development plans, highlighting resistance led by Indigenous peoples who have fought back against genocide and ongoing threats to their survival.</p>

        <p>The Ceiba tree&#x2019;s spreading buttress roots hold the scenes together and tell an overarching story of rootedness. This tree serves as a gathering
        place, a beacon in the center of town that brings people together to share stories and announce calls to action.</p>

        <p>A multitude of characters symbolize strategies and tactics
        for building and defending autonomy. Every critter in the poster is based on a real species native to somewhere between Mexico and Colombia. 400 individual species of insects, plants, and animals give a glimpse of the incredible biodiversity of the region.</p>

          <p>The invaders are unable to advance as they find themselves surrounded by a blockade of women

Scurrying beneath the dirt, they aerate the soil, making it possible for plants to grow, essentially laying the foundations for life on earth. While these ants seem small in the face of the entire forest, they outweigh all other animals and plants combined. The ants remind us that great changes are in the hands of the small and many. Working tirelessly, these miniscule creatures embody the phrase,
          la revoluci&#xF3;n es el trabajo de las hormigas (the revolution

            of being: &#x201C;we are the same because we are different;&#x201D; &#x201C;a world where many worlds fit.&#x201D; In the face of so

          <p>As European colonists invaded Central America, they brought with them the invasive European honey bee, which aggressively began to push the native Mesoamerican stingless bees out of their ecological niche. Today, deforestation, pollution, and industrial farming are destroying habitat and causing the collapse of pollinator species all over Central America. Bees are an indicator species, and the drastic decline of their populations may forecast a larger ecosystem collapse. Restoring native bee populations is vitally important to the health of ecosystems and agriculture globally, and is directly linked to the survival of Indigenous peoples and beekeeping knowledge. Traditional beekeeping is an intimate relationship between bees, people, culture,
          and the land.</p>

          <p>Pollinators and the plants they
          pollinate need each other. The
          native Melipona bee and the vanilla plant share one of these specific symbiotic relationships. Melipona bees from southern Mexico are the only natural pollinators of the delicate vanilla orchid. Without this specialized interaction, vanilla orchids would only survive by hand pollination, making vanilla one of the most labor intensive crops in the world.</p>

          Turning food
          scraps and garden
          waste into lush
          fertile soil, the
          bees and worms
          build future food
          systems, literally starting from the ground up.

          <p>Safeguarded at the top of the hive, the bee larvae are highly valued as they provide the base of the next generation and an investment
          in the future. Seeds and eggs are the currency
          of the economy that runs this bee
          society; they are the
          concentrated units that all life comes from, and speak to the symbiotic relationship between plants and pollinators.</p>
          <h4>Seeds of the future</h4>
          <p>As the larvae grow, so does their education. The newbees
          learn to cooperate and play together while pumping out honey with a seesaw. Other youth share what they&#x2019;ve learned about the colonial invasion of European stinging bees, through a mural and
          a play. Kites soar above, celebrating the young bees&#x2019; irrepressible spirit of resistance.</p>

          At the top of the hive, Melipona bees study the cosmos, learning from the cycles of the earth and moon. Informed by these natural cycles, the community can plan for planting and cultivating.

          <p>Facing the serious dangers of colony collapse, over 50 bee species have come together to build an alternative economic system that emphasizes horizontal and equitable relationships, while providing the basic needs of their community.</p>
          <p>The values of an extractive economy have led us to a mass extinction crisis and climate chaos. The holistic values of a solidarity economy are part of the antidote to this crisis. Like the bees, rebuilding local and regional networks can help us deal with the challenges and consequences of a rapidly changing planet. All the critters defending their land between the roots of the Ceiba are showing us the meaning of globalization from below: reaching out across borders, cultures, and generations to link movements and support each other&#x2019;s struggles for survival.
